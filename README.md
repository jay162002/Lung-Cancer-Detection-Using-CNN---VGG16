# Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-CNN---VGG16
This project is about detecting lung cancer from Chest CT-Scan images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built on top of the VGG16 pre-trained model. The main idea is to classify scans into different categories and help identify whether a patient shows signs of cancer  and if so, what type.
